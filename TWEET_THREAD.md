# AR.IO Bundler Launch Tweet Thread

## Tweet 1 (Announcement)
🚀 Excited to announce our **experimental AR.IO Bundler** with native x402 payment support!

We're building the future of decentralized data uploads with pay-as-you-go USDC payments—no accounts, no pre-funding, just upload and pay.

## Tweet 2 (x402 Integration)
⚡ **What makes this special?**

We've integrated Coinbase's x402 protocol as our PRIMARY payment method:

✅ Pay-as-you-go with USDC
✅ No ETH needed for gas (EIP-3009)
✅ No account creation required
✅ AI agent friendly - autonomous payments
✅ HTTP 402 Payment Required standard

---

## Tweet 3 (How it Works)
🔄 **The x402 flow is beautifully simple:**

1. Try to upload → Get 402 Payment Required
2. Sign USDC payment with MetaMask
3. Retry upload with X-PAYMENT header
4. Done! Data on Arweave, payment settled on-chain

All in real-time. All decentralized.

## Tweet 4 (Example Uploaders)
🛠️ **We built 3 production-ready examples:**

1️⃣ **x402-raw-upload.html** - Simplest approach using official x402-fetch library
2️⃣ **x402-upload-signed-data-item.html** - Full ANS-104 data item signing
3️⃣ **x402-upload-example.js** - Node.js CLI tool for backend integrations

All with full source code 👉 [GitHub link]

## Tweet 5 (Interactive Paywall)
💳 **Browser Paywall Feature:**

Our payment service serves an interactive HTML paywall for browsers:

🌐 Automatic browser detection
💰 Coinbase Onramp integration (buy USDC directly)
🔐 MetaMask one-click payments
🎨 Beautiful UI

Try it: Open any price quote URL in your browser!

---

## Tweet 6 (Network Support)
🌐 **Multi-chain support:**

Works on:
• Base Mainnet (recommended)
• Base Sepolia (testnet)
• Ethereum Mainnet
• Polygon

Uses native USDC contracts on each chain. No bridges needed.

Get test USDC: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-sepolia-faucet

---

## Tweet 7 (Technical Stack)
🔧 **Built with:**

• ANS-104 bundle standard
• AR.IO Gateway (vertically integrated)
• PostgreSQL + Redis + MinIO
• BullMQ for async job processing
• PM2 for process management
• 100% open source, self-hostable

Code: https://github.com/vilenarios/ar-io-bundler

---

## Tweet 8 (Why Experimental)
⚠️ **Why "experimental"?**

This is cutting-edge tech:
• First x402 implementation for Arweave
• New payment standard (HTTP 402)
• Vertically integrated gateway architecture
• Complete AWS → open source migration

Use at your own risk. Feedback welcome! 🙏

---

## Tweet 9 (Use Cases)
💡 **Perfect for:**

• AI agents that need data persistence
• Pay-per-use API integrations
• Anonymous data uploads
• Backend automation
• No-account-needed uploads

NOT for:
• High-volume production (yet)
• Mission-critical data (use turbo.ar.io)

---

## Tweet 10 (Call to Action)
🎯 **Try it out:**

1. Get test USDC from Base Sepolia faucet
2. Open our example uploaders
3. Connect MetaMask
4. Upload a file with USDC payment

Or use the Node.js CLI for automated uploads.
